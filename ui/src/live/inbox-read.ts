/**
 * Per-entry read tracking for the Inbox — Linear-style.
 *
 * Why per-entry, not a timestamp watermark: in an inbox-flow product,
 * "read" and "unread" are state-machine categories of attention, not
 * cosmetic indicators. Bulk-marking everything read on page visit (the
 * watermark approach) destroys the user's ability to triage — open inbox
 * with 10 unread items, look at one, all 10 silently become read. Per-entry
 * tracking preserves the "you've actively touched this one" semantic.
 *
 * Read state lives client-side in localStorage. Persists across reloads
 * but not across devices (single-tenant local-only product; cross-device
 * sync would need a server-side store).
