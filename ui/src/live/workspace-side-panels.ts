/**
 * User preference for the workspace right-pane Files panel.
 *
 * Stored at the user level (not per-workspace) — every workspace has the
 * same Files panel, so a per-workspace toggle would be friction for no
 * payoff. Toggled from the Files button in the workspace header; when off,
 * the right column collapses entirely and the terminal gets full width.
 *
 * Defaults to collapsed: in day-to-day chat-workspace use almost nobody
 * reads the raw files tree, so the terminal getting full width is the
 * better resting state. Users who do want it flip the Files button once
 * and the preference sticks.
 *
 * `autoHideMobile` hides the panel at sub-md viewports regardless. Default
 * true: on a phone, the right column eating 360px is worse than not seeing
 * files at all.
 *
 * (The Git panel was removed — nobody reads workspace git by hand anymore,
 * the agent does. So this is Files-only now.)
