/**
 * Centralized filesystem path resolution.
 *
 * Two roots, distinguished by lifecycle owner:
 *
 *   USER_DATA_HOME    user-produced state (config, sessions, broker
 *                     git-like commits, brain files, etc.). Survives
 *                     app upgrades and reinstalls. Default: ~/.openalice —
 *                     ONE store shared by every topology (pnpm dev, pnpm
 *                     start, packaged Electron), so broker credentials and
 *                     trading state are configured once, not per checkout.
 *                     Guardians still inject OPENALICE_HOME explicitly so
 *                     parent and children never derive the root twice;
 *                     `OPENALICE_HOME=$PWD pnpm dev` pins a checkout-local
 *                     store when an experiment shouldn't touch real data.
 *                     The `data/` subtree under it is the portable part
 *                     (back up / migrate / share THAT); machine-bound
 *                     secrets like sealing.key live beside it, not in it.
 *
 *   APP_RESOURCES_HOME   files shipped with the app (default templates,
 *                        the UI bundle). Replaced wholesale on app
 *                        upgrade. In production: .app/Contents/Resources/.
 *                        In dev: unset → repo root.
 *
 * Why two homes: user data must survive .app deletion and version
 * upgrades, while app resources must be replaced cleanly on upgrade.
 * Conflating them either loses user data on upgrade or keeps stale
 * default templates around forever.
