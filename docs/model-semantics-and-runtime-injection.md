# Model Semantics and Runtime Injection

This guide owns the boundary between AI resource credentials, model semantics,
Workspace model selection, and native Agent runtime launch projection. Read it
before changing provider presets, Workspace runtime defaults, model capability
fields, or the Claude Code, Codex, Cursor Agent, Grok Build, Oh My Pi, opencode, and Pi adapters.

## The Three-Layer Contract

OpenAlice does not run an in-process model loop. It prepares a native Agent CLI
to reach a selected model. That preparation has three distinct inputs:

```text
Credential access
  account/vendor + key/auth + region + supported wire endpoints
                         │
                         ▼
Model selection and semantic resolution
  model id + known limits/capabilities + explicit unknown-model overrides
                         │
                         ▼
Per-process runtime projection
  Claude Code / Codex / Cursor Agent / opencode / Oh My Pi / Pi argv + env for one immutable Session binding
```

### Credential access

A credential answers **how the user may reach an AI resource**. It owns the
secret, authentication kind, vendor identity, and the wire-shape-to-endpoint
map accepted by that key. It does not own a model's capabilities.

OpenRouter is a third-party gateway credential, not a first-party model
vendor. One key declares three wires: OpenAI Chat and Responses at
`https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`, and Anthropic Messages at
`https://openrouter.ai/api` (no `/v1`; the Anthropic SDK appends
`/v1/messages`). The Anthropic skin uses Bearer auth
(`ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`). Suggested model IDs are OpenRouter slugs
(`provider/model`); any other catalog ID may be pasted. The current coding
default is `openai/gpt-5.6-luna`. The suggestion list also includes
OpenRouter's current top-weekly text models (`deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash-0731`,
`tencent/hy3`, `openai/gpt-5.6-luna`, `z-ai/glm-5.2`, `xiaomi/mimo-v2.5`).
Existing Custom credentials that already point at `openrouter.ai` keep
working as `custom`.

`Credential.lastModel` is a remembered selection hint. It saves the user from
retyping the last model used with an account, but it does not make the model an
intrinsic property of the credential and must never store a copied capability
snapshot.

### Model selection and semantics

A selection answers **which model the Workspace should use**. The model
registry resolves a known `(vendor, model id)` into stable semantic facts such
as context/output limits and reasoning behavior. Agent adapters consume that
resolved result; UI forms must not ask users to rediscover known facts.

Model semantics are tri-state. A missing field means **unknown**, not false.
This matters for free-typed model ids and private gateways: writing a false
capability can disable a runtime's own model detection, while omitting an
unknown capability preserves the native fallback.

Reasoning is not one universal API field. The registry describes behavior:

- `none`: the model does not expose a reasoning mode;
- `optional`: reasoning is supported and may be enabled or disabled;
- `adaptive`: the model chooses whether/how much to reason, influenced by
  effort;
- `required`: the model rejects requests that disable or omit reasoning.

Effort levels, defaults, and interleaved reasoning are separate facts. The
registry must not collapse them back into one boolean merely because Pi and
opencode currently accept a coarse `reasoning` capability bit.

### Per-process runtime projection

An adapter answers **how the selected resource and model preference are
expressed for one Agent process**. It maps a shared resolved binding into the
runtime's native launch interface:

- Pi provider/model registration plus `--model` and `--thinking`;
- opencode provider/model environment plus `--model` and `--variant`;
- Claude Code endpoint/auth environment plus `--model` and `--effort`;
- Cursor Agent native authentication or a Cursor provider credential projected
  as `CURSOR_API_KEY`, plus `--model` only (live CLI rejects
  `id[effort=…]`; catalog ids already
  encode effort as suffixes such as `gpt-5.2-low`);
- Antigravity native authentication or an optional Gemini key projected as
  `GEMINI_API_KEY` (and `GOOGLE_GEMINI_BASE_URL` only for a custom host), plus
  `--model` and `--effort low|medium|high`. `GEMINI_API_KEY` alone has no
  effect unless the user already set `modelProvider: "gemini"` in
  `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json`; Alice does not write that file.
  Alice launches PATH `agy` only — never `antigravity` or `gemini`;
- Grok Build `XAI_API_KEY` / optional `GROK_MODELS_BASE_URL` plus `--model`
  and `--effort`;
- Oh My Pi provider env plus `--model` and `--thinking`;
- Codex provider arguments/environment plus `--model` and
  `model_reasoning_effort` configuration arguments.

Writing the same values into native project files is a deprecated compatibility
export for users who intentionally start the CLI outside OpenAlice. It is not a
managed Session default, readiness gate, or launch-time fallback. Grok Build
has no workspace-local project file, so it has no `writeAiConfig` export:
vault keys enter the child as `XAI_API_KEY` (and `GROK_MODELS_BASE_URL` only
for a custom host). Headless stdout is Grok 1.0.4 flattened `streaming-json`,
not ACP-wrapped `session/update`. Cursor Agent likewise has no workspace-local
project file. It authenticates through its own login when a Session selects
native access. A Cursor Dashboard key uses the same provider credential schema
as every other vault entry, with vendor `cursor`; the adapter consumes that
provider directly as `CURSOR_API_KEY` rather than pretending it speaks an
OpenAI wire. Arbitrary OpenAI-compatible keys are not Cursor Dashboard
credentials and are never projected into the child. Alice launches PATH
`cursor-agent` only — never the
colliding `agent` name Grok's installer also claims. Headless stdout is
documented `stream-json` (`system/init` carries `session_id`). Live print
mode also emits `thinking` delta/completed events; Alice extractors ignore
them. Do not pass `--stream-partial-output`.

Claude Code managed-Vault launches select only the `project` settings source
before projecting the Session's endpoint, credential, model, and effort. Claude
otherwise reapplies provider-shaped `env` from user and local settings after
inheriting the child environment, which can silently replace an immutable
Session binding. Keeping the project source enabled preserves Claude's native
Workspace `CLAUDE.md` persona and `.claude/skills` discovery without importing
an unrelated global login or deprecated `.claude/settings.local.json` export.
Runtime-managed bindings do not restrict the source chain: OpenAlice deliberately
leaves Claude's complete authentication, configuration, and skill discovery in
control, whether it resolves from login, environment, user settings, or local
project files. Launcher-owned explicit `--settings` remain available in both
modes.

A registered provider default is descriptive model metadata, not an implicit
Session launch parameter. OpenAlice may label that default in selection help,
but it persists and projects an effort only when a Workspace preference, Issue,
or one-launch choice explicitly selects one. Omitted effort stays omitted all
the way through the Session binding and adapter so the selected model/provider
may apply its own behavior. A model that documents only a thinking switch (for
example LongCat 2.0) keeps `defaultEnabled` separate and never receives a
fabricated effort tier.

Wire selection normally follows the same rule: an explicit Workspace or
creation-default protocol wins. A registered runtime incompatibility is the
narrow exception. MiniMax's OpenAI Chat endpoint only separates thinking when
`reasoning_split` is set, then returns it through the array-shaped
`reasoning_details` extension. Pi and opencode's generic OpenAI transports do
not consume that extension losslessly. Their own native MiniMax registrations,
Models.dev, and MiniMax's AI SDK provider all choose the Anthropic-compatible
path instead. OpenAlice therefore exposes only the Anthropic MiniMax wire to Pi
and opencode; an old saved MiniMax OpenAI preference is repaired to Anthropic
when it is next selected or explicitly exported for compatibility, so native
thinking blocks and multi-turn replay survive.

The native fields are deliberately runtime-owned projections of the same
resolved value:

- Pi: project `defaultThinkingLevel` (`none` maps to Pi's native `off`);
- opencode: model-level `options` in the provider SDK's native shape;
- Claude Code: project `effortLevel` (only values Claude can persist);
- Cursor Agent: `--model <id>` only. Live `2026.08.11-e8db854` treats
  `id[effort=…]` as an unknown model name even though help still documents
  brackets. Do not invent `--effort` or rewrite ids. Issue / launch
  suggestions are the first-party Cursor Models pool plus `auto`
  (`src/workspaces/adapters/cursor-models.ts`); third-party ids stay
  free-typed. Effort and Fast are suffixes on the CLI id
  (`cursor-grok-4.6-high-fast`), not a separate picker;
- Antigravity: `--model <slug>` plus `--effort low|medium|high`. `agy models`
  is filtered by auth type and billing tier — a free Gemini API key returns
  raw API ids; an Antigravity account returns effort-suffixed slugs. Do not
  invent a suffix mapper. Issue / launch suggestions are the union of those
  Gemini pools (`src/workspaces/adapters/agy-models.ts`); Claude and other
  third-party ids stay free-typed. `ultra` / `xhigh` / `max` / `none` /
  `minimal` are rejected. Headless stdout is documented `stream-json`
  (`init` carries `conversation_id`). Resume is `--conversation` /
  `--continue`, not `--resume`. Bind the prompt with `-p <prompt>`; do not
  use a `--` terminator;
- Grok Build: `--effort` (`none` through `max` / `xhigh`; `ultra` is rejected).
  Issue / launch suggestions are the live `grok models` ids
  (`src/workspaces/adapters/grok-models.ts`): `grok-4.6` (CLI default) and
  `grok-4.5`. grok-4.6 advertises low / medium / high / xhigh; grok-4.5 omits
  xhigh. A free-typed unknown id keeps the canonical CLI set. Do not offer
  the retired `grok-build` alias;
- Codex: project `model_reasoning_effort`.

### Workspace settings and durable Session bindings

`.alice/settings.json` is the self-describing, secret-free policy and fallback
for creating a product Session. Version 3 stores separate `interactive` and
`headless` launch modes. Each mode owns:

- an optional fixed default Agent runtime;
- an optional fixed credential/model/effort tuple per Agent runtime; and
- a separate automatically remembered recent Agent and recent tuple per Agent.

"Follow recent" means the fixed field is absent. A successful launch updates
only the recent layer and therefore cannot overwrite a user-pinned default.
The 0.89.2-beta baseline accepts only the current version 3 interactive/headless
shape; the unreleased version 1/2 development formats are intentionally not a
permanent dual-read or migration boundary. Remembered values never become fixed
defaults merely because an older development build stored them.
Vault choices store only the credential slug and, when the provider uses a
model API protocol, its wire shape. Runtime-direct provider credentials such as
Cursor omit the inapplicable wire shape. Keys and resolved provider payloads
never enter the Workspace file.

A fresh Session resolves that surface/Agent preference together with any
explicit credential, model, or effort choice into one immutable, secret-free
`SessionRuntimeBinding` owned by its `resumeId`. It is written to
`.alice/sessions/<resumeId>.json` in the owning Workspace, as the `ai`
object. An optional sibling `displayName` is the mutable coworker nametag
and is not part of this binding. The global resume registry stores identity,
lifecycle, and native-session mapping only; it hydrates the binding and
nametag from the Workspace file when Alice starts and never flushes either
into `resume-identities.json`. The binding is
then projected on every launch of that Session:
interactive TUI, structured Web surface, headless Issue turn, and exact resume.
It is not a headless-only override.

The launcher-owned Workspace Manager has no business Workspace checkout. Its
equivalent binding files live at
`<launcherRoot>/state/workspace-manager-sessions/<resumeId>.json` so the active
Workspace-floor root remains free of control-plane artifacts.

Fresh Session runtime selection follows the same ownership rule. Ask Alice,
the Workspace sidebar, and interactive CLI/API starts use `interactive`;
Issues, schedules, automation, and headless CLI/API starts use `headless`. An explicit
Quick Chat, sidebar, Issue, CLI, or API runtime choice wins for that one
Session. Otherwise OpenAlice uses the mode's fixed Agent, then its recent
Agent, then the legacy `.alice/workspace.json` `defaultAgent`, then the
installation-wide `workspaceDefaultAgent`. If none resolves to a registered
Agent runtime, Alice falls back to the first registered runtime. Headless mode
defaults must resolve to a headless-capable Agent.

| Runtime | Workspace preference | Per-process Session projection |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `.alice/settings.json` interactive/headless fixed then recent tuple | `--model`, `--effort`, credential env |
| Codex | `.alice/settings.json` interactive/headless fixed then recent tuple | `--model`, `-c model_reasoning_effort=...`, provider projection |
| Cursor Agent | `.alice/settings.json` interactive/headless fixed then recent tuple | `--model`; native login or Cursor provider credential projected as `CURSOR_API_KEY` |
| Grok Build | `.alice/settings.json` interactive/headless fixed then recent tuple | `--model`, `--effort`, `XAI_API_KEY` / optional `GROK_MODELS_BASE_URL` |
| Oh My Pi | `.alice/settings.json` interactive/headless fixed then recent tuple | `--model`, `--thinking`, provider env |
| opencode | `.alice/settings.json` interactive/headless fixed then recent tuple | `--model`, `--variant`, provider projection |
| Pi | `.alice/settings.json` interactive/headless fixed then recent tuple | `--model`, `--thinking`, provider projection |

Within the selected Agent, each launch dimension resolves from the explicit
one-launch selection first, then the mode's fixed tuple, then the matching
recent tuple, then native runtime state. A fixed tuple is treated as one
credential/model/effort decision: switching its credential never carries a
model or effort from a different recent credential invisibly. Registry
`defaultEffort` metadata is not another resolution layer: when none of those
sources explicitly selects an effort, the binding omits it.

An Issue's agent/credential-or-credentialSource/model/effort fields seed a new
Session binding when its owner is `@new-then-resume` or `@new-each-run`.
`credentialSource: native` explicitly returns management to the Agent runtime;
`credential` is
only an OpenAlice-vault slug. Omitting both inherits the Workspace headless
tuple. Neither form ever contains a key or endpoint. Once an exact
`@resumeId` exists, Issue frontmatter cannot replace its credential source,
model, or effort. The Issue page and paused Session settings may still replace
those three dimensions on the stored binding; the Agent runtime stays frozen.
Those editors, plus Workspace interactive/headless preference rows, share one
pinned runtime draft (`usePinnedRuntimeDraft`) and `AgentLaunchSelectors`.
Unknown model ids are typed through the shared custom-model dialog; they are
not limited to the preset catalog.
Follow-up turns replay the stored binding instead of consulting newly
changed Workspace defaults.

The persisted credential component records only an ownership reference:
native runtime state or an OpenAlice-vault slug plus wire shape. Legacy Session
bindings may still contain a fingerprint of an explicitly configured native
project provider so they can fail safely when that provider changes. Vault secrets are resolved
just in time and enter only the child environment. Workspace fingerprints make
replacement visible instead of silently resuming through a different key.
Paused Session surfaces may expose that secret-free binding so users can verify
the credential source, model, and effort that will be replayed before resuming;
they must never expose resolved keys, endpoints, or native runtime identifiers.

Credential, model, and effort are independent optional launch dimensions. A
runtime-managed credential binding means OpenAlice injects no managed key,
endpoint, or provider configuration; the Agent runtime owns authentication and
provider discovery through its complete native chain. That binding may still
carry a process-level model or effort override. A binding with neither override
is also valid and must still traverse the adapter projection seam, even when the
resulting projection is empty.

Compact launch surfaces may present model and effort through one disclosure,
but the nested choices must remain independently selectable and preserve the
credential-to-model-to-effort dependency order. Free-typed model ids remain
available because registry suggestions are not an allowlist. Credential menus
should state which runtime is receiving AI access before listing Workspace,
runtime-managed, and saved-vault choices.

Legacy resume identities that predate this binding contract are upgraded to an
explicit native binding on their next activation. They must not inspect and
adopt a provider that was added to the Workspace after the Session was created.
Fresh managed Sessions likewise never infer defaults from native project files.

Every Agent adapter must implement `sessionRuntime.project(...)`. Registration
rejects an Agent adapter without that contract; utility adapters such as Shell
explicitly opt out. The adapter maps the same resolved binding to its native
arguments and environment for every supported surface. Adapter argv must never
contain credential material.

Codex project configuration must not be confused with `CODEX_HOME`; the latter
owns global auth, sessions, skills, and user configuration. Provider definitions
are not a supported Codex project layer, so OpenAlice-managed custom providers
use an explicit `.codex/openalice-home/`, while model/effort-only login-backed
preferences leave `CODEX_HOME` unset.

Context-window and output limits follow the same ownership boundary. Registered
model semantics provide known limits; an explicit Workspace preference may
override the context registration for runtimes that support it; otherwise the
native Agent fallback wins. Alice must not add a global context/output ceiling
or run a parallel automatic compactor. Creation defaults may keep an explicit
context preference only inside the selected agent/model binding; there is no
cross-model context default. The retired `compaction.json` contract and
`workspaceDefaultContextWindow` field predate the 0.89.2-beta baseline. Native
Agent compaction events remain observable UI state, not an Alice policy layer.

## Registry Ownership

`src/ai-providers/model-semantics.ts` is the curated, offline semantic registry.
`src/ai-providers/preset-catalog.ts` owns the provider/model suggestions and
attaches exact registry matches to those model records. Model lists remain
suggestions rather than allowlists: every model field keeps free-text entry.

The serialized preset contract exposes model records directly to the UI.
JSON Schema continues to describe form validation, but it is not the semantic
database. A single resolver owns exact-id/alias matching and the unknown-model
fallback so the UI, Workspace defaults, and adapter projections cannot drift.

The registry is repository data, not persisted user state. Updating a known
model changes future resolution but must not silently rewrite existing
Workspace files. Existing configurations change only through their normal
explicit apply/create paths.

Runtime compatibility belongs to the runtime adapter, not to the shared
credential or route layers. Every provider-capable adapter declares
`capabilities.aiProvider` with:

- whether native/global login is sufficient or a Workspace credential is
  required;
- accepted wire shapes in native preference order and the blank-form default;
- any vendor-specific wire narrowing and narrowly scoped legacy repair;
- which custom-model facts it registers (`contextWindow`, `reasoning`, and
  effort variants).

`src/workspaces/adapters/index.ts` is the single built-in registration point.
The Workspace `/agents` contract serializes these declarations for UI launch,
credential, and model controls. Adding a provider-capable runtime therefore
means implementing its adapter, declaring these capabilities, and registering
it once. Shared binding resolution, readiness, compatibility routes, and UI
helpers must not add a second adapter-id matrix. Runtime-exclusive behavior such as a structured
surface, transcript parser, native config format, or CLI argument spelling
remains in the adapter or its explicitly runtime-owned UI.

An upstream catalog such as Models.dev may later generate part of this table at
build time. OpenAlice-specific overrides still own protocol quirks and runtime
compatibility, and Workspace launch must not depend on a live catalog fetch.

## User Experience

For a registered model, the normal flow asks for account/region/key/model and
derives capability fields automatically. The UI shows the explicit effort, or
clearly says that effort is not specified; provider defaults may appear as
descriptive help but must not masquerade as persisted Session input. It must not
require a reasoning checkbox or context-window guess for known facts.
When the provider publishes no effort tiers, the UI shows the actual thinking
policy (on/off/required/unknown) rather than rendering an empty effort control.

For an unknown free-typed model, the runtime fallback is the default. Advanced
overrides remain available for facts OpenAlice cannot discover. An override is
bound to the selected model id (`reasoningModel` in creation defaults); changing
models must not carry an old model's capability assertion forward invisibly.

Issue launch controls follow the same ownership chain as Session creation. The
user first chooses Workspace/native auth or one compatible vault credential,
then sees model suggestions from that credential's provider catalog, then sees
only the registered effort tiers for the selected model. Free-typed model ids
remain available; because their semantics are unknown, their effort picker
falls back to the selected Agent runtime's native range.

Connection probes verify that a key, endpoint, wire shape, and model can answer.
They do not prove the complete capability set. Error-guided retries (for
example, a model that mandates thinking) are useful diagnostics but do not
replace the curated registry.

The UI must not present resolved launch values as if every value were already
written to the Workspace. Detailed persistence ownership belongs in explicit
Workspace settings and documentation, not as permanent implementation prose in
the primary send path. Quick Start separates Workspace and Agent runtime as the
Session launch context from AI access, model, and effort inside the composer.
The visible effective choices are sufficient disclosure there: selecting a
vault credential must not rewrite the Workspace, and changing a creation
default never rewrites an existing Workspace. Successful explicit Workspace
saves use transient confirmation instead of a permanent success state.
This disclosure applies to all four supported Agent runtimes. Claude Code and
Codex use their native global login and global runtime configuration by default.
Merely storing a compatible credential in Alice never selects or injects it;
only an explicit Session selection, Workspace fixed/recent preference, or
new-Workspace creation seed overrides the native fallback. The visible values
come from `.alice/settings.json` and the pending Session binding, never by
reverse-engineering a native project file in the primary launch path.

Headless provider readiness does not prove that an interactive TUI can consume
its first queued prompt immediately. A native runtime may still own global
onboarding or per-project trust gates. OpenAlice may expose those gates as
read-only, best-effort launch guidance, but it must not mark private global
state complete or accept trust on the user's behalf. Unknown native state is
advisory and fail-open; it never becomes a fabricated ready/not-ready fact.

The test-before-save gate follows the same boundary as the probe. Changes to a
managed key, endpoint, wire shape, authentication mode, or its model require a
fresh probe. A Codex/Claude runtime-managed binding with no OpenAlice-managed key
or endpoint has no HTTP credential for the modal to probe: model/effort-only
changes save directly and are validated by the native runtime at launch.
Context-window, reasoning capability, and reasoning effort are also local
runtime registration fields and save without an unrelated provider request.
Official endpoints may be omitted because the probe resolves their default from
the wire shape. Both automatic creation-default saves and explicit Workspace
saves must acknowledge completion in the UI.

## Native Authentication and Explicit Overrides

Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, and Pi can all own their complete authentication
and provider-configuration state.
OpenAlice launches them against that state by default and must not require an
OpenAlice-vault credential merely because a Workspace has no managed provider
binding. Runtime readiness probes exercise the selected Workspace runtime
binding; they never inject the first compatible vault entry as a fallback and
never mutate native project configuration while diagnosing readiness.
Readiness is diagnostic rather than a synchronous preflight: ordinary Chat,
Manager, Session spawn, and Session resume proceed through the selected native
runtime without waiting for a probe. Onboarding, explicit Retry, and background
health surfaces may probe and cache the result without becoming a launch gate.

Choosing an OpenAlice credential is an explicit override. A fresh Session may
bind that vault reference without writing it into the Workspace or changing the
runtime's global state. An absent choice means
“use the runtime default”; it does not mean “pick any compatible credential.”
Existing Session bindings remain authoritative until that Session is retired
or the user explicitly replaces the binding while it is paused. A paused edit
updates the secret-free `.alice/sessions/<resumeId>.json` `ai` object without
waking the Session or rewriting `displayName`; the replacement credential,
model, and effort take effect on its next resume. OpenAlice never imports a runtime-global secret into its
vault or a Workspace.

Native “global” state follows the runtime actually launched. A source or
user-installed Pi uses its own normal global agent directory. Packaged managed
Pi uses the instance-scoped `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` under the complete OpenAlice
home, so `/login` persists for that managed runtime without reading or changing
a separately installed shell Pi. Authentication/provider failures from either
path must settle launch UI state and point users to native CLI login first;
OpenAlice provider setup remains an optional explicit alternative.

## Deprecated Native Config Export and Reset

Native Agent configuration files may contain user- or runtime-owned settings.
The compatibility exporter must update only OpenAlice-owned keys/nodes,
preserve unknown data, and restore the prior value on reset where a shared
scalar is overridden. It is reached through the advanced deprecated surface;
normal Workspace creation, Quick Chat, Issues, probes, WebPi, and resume do not
call it.

Pi uses one generic OpenAlice-managed project extension plus local provider and
binding/rollback state. The extension registers only the provider stored in
that Workspace's sensitive `.pi/openalice-provider.json`; Pi's global
`models.json` remains user-owned. Claude Code and opencode use the same
lifecycle rule with
`.claude/openalice-provider.json` and `.opencode/openalice-provider.json`:
the first write snapshots only the nodes OpenAlice will replace, later writes
retain that original snapshot, and reset restores a node only if it still equals
the last injected value. A user edit or whole-file deletion made after injection
wins.

Codex applies the same reversible ownership rule to top-level `model` and
`model_reasoning_effort` assignments in the shared project
`.codex/config.toml`; comments, sections, and unknown keys remain untouched.
Only `.codex/openalice-home/` is an exclusive `CODEX_HOME`, and only while an
OpenAlice-managed custom provider is active. Reset removes that dedicated home
and restores owned project scalars without deleting the user's `.codex/`
directory or global login state.

The rollback sidecars can contain prior or injected secrets and are therefore
sensitive Workspace state. Templates must exclude both sidecars and native
provider config files from git. They must never be logged or copied into test
snapshots.

Secrets remain excluded from git and logs. Semantic registry entries never
contain credentials.

## Verification Invariants

Tests for this subsystem must cover:

- every built-in vendor default resolves to a registered model;
- exact ids and declared aliases resolve, while unknown ids remain unknown;
- omitted semantic fields do not become false during serialization;
- registered reasoning models reach Pi and opencode without a manual toggle;
- explicit effort choices round-trip through all four native runtimes;
- omitted effort remains absent even when the selected model publishes a default;
- provider-only thinking switches never become fabricated effort values;
- non-reasoning and unknown models do not receive fabricated capabilities;
- model changes cannot retain a capability override for the previous id;
- a synthetic unknown adapter works from its capability declaration without a
  shared-layer id branch;
- adapter write/read/write round trips preserve semantic fields;
- reset removes only OpenAlice-owned configuration and restores prior values;
- credential secrets never appear in logs, docs, committed fixtures, or test snapshots;
- sensitive rollback sidecars remain excluded from git alongside native provider config.
- readiness probes never create or replace a Workspace provider binding;
- diagnostic readiness failures never block an ordinary native launch or resume;
- missing OpenAlice credentials never block a runtime that can manage its own access;
- failed interactive resumes return a visible error and remain retryable.

## Registry Maintenance

Add a semantic fact only when provider documentation or a reproducible live
compatibility check supports it. Record the source beside the registry data.
If public surfaces disagree, omit that field and preserve the unknown state;
for example, GLM 5.2 reasoning is registered while its disputed context limit
is deliberately absent.

When a provider changes a model in place, update the registry and its unit
tests together. Existing Workspace files are not rewritten in the background;
the new facts apply on the next explicit provider apply or Workspace creation.
