# OpenAlice Owner Guides

This directory holds durable subsystem truth. `AGENTS.md` is the compact
startup index; detailed rules belong here and should be loaded only when the
task touches their scope.

Use wikilinks as stable agent-facing routes and ordinary Markdown links for
GitHub navigation.

Other files under `docs/images/` are README/product assets rather than owner
guides.

## User Quickstarts

- [[docs/remote-quickstart.md]] — [Remote quickstart](remote-quickstart.md):
  install the stable CLI, prepare a private SSH host, connect and reconnect,
  understand Server lifetime and security, and see the design inspiration
  behind the remote path.

Reference notes under `docs/reference/` are non-authoritative research
material. The [installer script note](reference/install-script/README.md)
records Claude Code and Codex upstream links and design lessons without
vendoring third-party code. The
[Pi and Herdr CLI architecture note](reference/pi-herdr-cli-architecture.md)
pins the TypeScript TUI, startup, configuration, persistent Runtime, command,
and running-update comparison behind the Shell CLI plan. The
[Herdr remote Runtime note](reference/herdr-remote-architecture.md) records a
pinned public-source architecture comparison behind the authoritative remote
guide, also without vendoring third-party code.

## Incident Records

- [[docs/incidents/2026-07-28-broker-pack-upgrade-gap.md]] —
  [v0.85 Broker Pack upgrade gap](incidents/2026-07-28-broker-pack-upgrade-gap.md):
  previous-release Pack activation failed after a desktop upgrade and
  established the N-1→N release gate.

## Maintenance Rule

- Every owner guide states what it owns and points to the current load-bearing
  code paths.
- When code and a guide disagree, verify the runtime and update the guide in the
  same change.
- Do not copy an owner guide back into `AGENTS.md`; add or update its wikilink.
- Do not leave executable instructions in a retired guide. Keep a short
  tombstone when old external links need a destination.
- Prefer self-describing code/catalogs over copied provider, event, or route
  inventories that immediately drift.
